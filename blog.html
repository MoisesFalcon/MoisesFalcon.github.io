            <p>The hardest parts with this assignment for me wasn't the actual assignment but getting everything working.</p>
            <p>Things like visual code studio and github and figuring out how it all worked is what I spent most my time on.</p>
            <p>Luckly I got some friends who already took this class and so they showed me on what I needed to download and how to operate the systems.</p>
            <p>Everything in this course is all new so I'm definitely learning a lot.</p>
